						<p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the core language used to create and structure web content. It defines the layout of a web page, including elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. Think of HTML as the foundation that every website is built upon‚Äîwithout it, there wouldn't be any text or media to display. It‚Äôs simple, efficient, and essential for any web development project. If you want to build anything online, learning HTML is the first step.</p>

						<p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the language that controls the presentation of a web page. It allows you to style and design HTML elements by applying rules for colors, fonts, spacing, and layouts. With CSS, you can create visually appealing websites that are responsive and user-friendly, ensuring a consistent experience across all devices. It‚Äôs the tool that transforms a basic HTML structure into a polished and professional website, giving developers complete control over the look and feel of their projects.</p>
